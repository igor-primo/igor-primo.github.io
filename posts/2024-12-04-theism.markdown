## The statement of the problem

### The logic problem

Most theists and atheists will rely on analytic/deductive
arguments and strategies to make their point in discussions
about the existence of divinity. These strategies are inconclusive.

All mathematical theories start by setting axioms, which
are thought to be self-evident truths that need no demonstration.
If and when a mathematical theory is shown to be inconsistent,
some of the axioms must be dropped, but not all theorems in the theory

<span class="sidenote">
This phenomenon has been dealt with in details by Pierre Duheim and
Orman Quine.
</span>.

This fact holds even tighter with respect to the theories we
sing about actual objects that can act or be acted upon

<span class="sidenote">
Peter Geach has a fine discussion on what should be said about actual objects.
</span>.
This comes about because of human ignorance of some causes whose effects will
interfere, or have interfered, in our forecastings or in our beliefs about
present things (but we are still not aware of). The known causes, in our
language, figure as propositions in the conjunction that constitute the
antecedent (also called our assumptions, or premises) in the conditionals we
hold as premises to deduce intellectual or practical conclusions by *modus ponens*.

When we are humbled by an error, we invoke *modus tollens*, naturally. And this
means we must deny the conjunction of our premises. Intellectual honesty, and
logical acuity, forces us to pick and choose which premise to drop, but not
always it is clear which one. In fact, we may ***not even know*** the corresponding
premise of  the cause that falsified our deduction attempt

<span class="sidenote">
Example.
</span>.

It follows that deductive reasoning should be thought of as a brute force
strategy to verify and enhance our assumptions. We acquire an intuition of our
premises by induction. We assume the premise and test by experimentation. If our
experiment goes well we are not at all allowed to take that assumption for
granted.  But also, if our expectation is not met, we are not obliged to drop it
either.

This is how things are. This note also shows that careful orchestration
of science experiments is of paramount importance for science.

### Not an argument by ignorance. The meaning problem.

I say this not to vindicate any argument by ignorance. I think both
atheist and theists are often guilty of ignorance of what I just said.

Immature atheists are often guilty of pursuing the so-called argument of evil.
If God exists and is supremely good, then He wouldn't allow so much suffering in
the world.  But there is so much suffering in the world. Therefore, either God
does not exist or God is not supremely good, but theists will not allow this
second implication. In all argumentation there must be concord in the
understanding of terms and a willingness to track reality. The Jews of old
confessed God's goodness while confessing that He is also terrible

       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">

<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-psalm-terrible"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
Quoniam magnus Dominus et laudabilis nimis, terribilis est super omnes deos. (Ps. 96)
</span>.
For them, God is good because He is a provider, a Father that punishes
only so much, moderating His anger with acts of mercy. If the atheist finds
this strange, it is for him to grow in culture and as a person. In any case,
reality is a harsh teacher and will not succumb to our concepts. **We** should
adapt our concepts to reality. If God is good while punishing his creatures
for their offenses, thinking He is bad does not change reality if reality is so.

The difficulty of tracking reality, together with the inconclusiveness of
individual human experience, gives room to all sorts of arbitrariness.
This, I think is why there are so many and so strange opinions in currency today.
